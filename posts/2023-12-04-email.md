First and foremost, if you've tried to email me recently, I'm sorry that they've been bouncing! If you want to get in touch with me, that contact should now be open!

[I'm not interested in the story, take me to the list!]()

### Wait, what happened?

Back in September I moved my site from Github Pages to Digital Ocean, with plans to do something Big And Grand with it. Whilst those plans are still in progress, it was early in December when I'd gone to check some domain configuration and noticed that my email configuration had changed. Due to moving my DNS records to DO, my domain provider could no longer redirect my emails for me.

Whilst I wasn't flooded by emails on the daily (thank goodness!), this did mean I've missed two months of emails - not great! As much as playing around with templating was fun, this definitely needed to be pinned to the top of the list.

There are, of course, plenty of options out there for someone who needs their emails sent from a domain to an inbox. Below I've listed the ones I took a look into with a brief description of each.

A quick search suggested that I could, in fact, route my emails via DigitalOcean. Handy! Looking into it, however, made it rapidly clear that it wasn't for me - it involves servers and setup and configuration on a droplet. I'm still very nervous around such things

* What happened - moved to DO in Sept, checked domain provider recently, realised emails were no longer controlled by domain provider
* What next - looked into how to set up email provider on DO and various alternatives
* DO setup - very manual, requires a droplet
* SimpleLogin - Mostly fine, though had issues with setting up the domain records
* Tuta - Looks like a great service, but not what I wanted in a service (I just want to redirect to my existing inbox!)
* Forwardemail - Fine, seemed to take time with domain records but got it working in the end

With that, I can finally receive emails again! Hurrah!
