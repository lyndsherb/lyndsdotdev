First and foremost, if you've tried to email me recently, I'm sorry that they've been bouncing! If you want to get in touch with me, that contact should now be open!

* What happened - moved to DO in Sept, checked domain provider recently, realised emails were no longer controlled by domain provider
* What next - looked into how to set up email provider on DO and various alternatives
* DO setup - very manual, requires a droplet
* SimpleLogin - Mostly fine, though had issues with setting up the domain records
* Tuta - Looks like a great service, but not what I wanted in a service (I just want to redirect to my existing inbox!)
* Forwardemail - Fine, seemed to take time with domain records but got it working in the end

With that, I can finally receive emails again! Hurrah!
