Why hello there! Welcome to my blog!

I'm Lyndsey - I'm a principal front-end developer currently based in Manchester. This has been a side project I've been working on for a number of years and I'm glad to get it up and running!

So, what content can you expect to see from me? A good starting point is posting about the blog itself. At the time of writing, the site is sparse, being just this one post. The site is currently built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11ty</a>, which is new to me, so expect a lot of posts addressing how I go about building a new feature, or any roadblocks I stumble across. I will also use this blog to post cool code snippets or talk about any cool things I've been looking into.

That's all for now - just a short post to say hello! In the meantime, you can follow my projects on <a href="https://github.com/lyndsherb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a> or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lyndsherb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linkedin</a>.

Thanks for reading, and I'll see you soon!
