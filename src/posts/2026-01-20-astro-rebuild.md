- Happy New Year, Welcome Back
- Changed to Astro
- Why? Nice to develop with, closer to what I'm used to (JSX-style syntax vs Nunchucks)
- Now includes tags and tag pages
- Still lots to tidy up
- Want to redo the layout
- But it's good for now
- Still lots of other minor projects to work on (see last post)
- But welcome Astro to the blog
