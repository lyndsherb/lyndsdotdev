Happy New Year! Welcome back to my blog and my posts! 

2025 was certainly an... _interesting_ year, but if you're reading this, you made it. We all did. (Proud of us.) 2026 is looking to be a good year. At least, I can hope for the best! 

The eagle-eyed visitors among you might notice that in the past couple of days, there's been a couple of changes - namely, the 'Powered by' link has changed from <a href="https://www.11ty.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11ty</a> to <a href="https://www.astro.build" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro</a>. That's right, I've replatformed my blog - all 5 (now 6) posts of it! It was a fun exercise, and I'm glad I gave it a go. 

### Why Astro? 

In [my last post](/posts/2025-08-31-been-a-while), I mentioned I was embarking on a project with some friends of mine. One friend suggested looking into Astro, as they'd recently seen someone else use it to good effect. It didn't seem like it would be quite right for our project - we need a CMS - but I still decided to have a poke around and follow the tutorial. You know, for funsies. 

I was right - Astro wasn't quite what _that_ project needs, at least not yet. (I'm conscious that I can use Astro to build a CMS, but that's also not what I'm looking to do right now). However, it felt very nice to develop with - a lot closer to how I develop nowadays, with a more JSX-y syntax for the layouts and components. 

(I know 11ty allows for users to choose their own templating language - it was actually something I was idly working on! But along came Astro...)

Me being me, that got me excited to try it out for myself, so I set about starting a new blog from scratch. Three lazy days later (a couple of hours here and there - about 6 - 8 hours in total), not only did I have everything ported over, but I also had some new features (namely post tags) that I've been meaning to do for a while! 

In short - I went from playing about with Astro to a fully functioning blog in less than a weekend. It was easy to do, it's nice to use and I'm looking forward to working with it some more! 

### But your site looks the same! 

It does! If I'd changed the styles, things would have taken a bit longer, it's true. Stopping now is good though; if I decided to overhaul everything at once, I'd be tweaking things for weeks! 

Alongside the styles needing a refresh, there's also a few chunks of code that could do with some tidying. As with all things, sometimes you just need to know when it's GETMO - Good Enough to Move On. And now is that time! 

### And that's a wrap (for now)

Thanks all for sticking with me this far - it's been fun. I still have the projects I outlined in [my last post](/posts/2025-08-31-been-a-while) to work on, so look out for posts about those. 

I'm still very thankful that I found 11ty when I did. Thank you to the 11ty team for your hard work and development on your project, that allowed me to start my blog in the first place. 

In the meantime, if there's anything more you want to know about this rebuild, feel free to email me with the link below and ask away. 

Thanks again for your time, and I wish you all a happy and peaceful 2026!
